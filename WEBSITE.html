		<div1 style="position:absolute;left:555px;top:100px;width:700px; height:370px;font-family:arial;font-size:17.5px">The 20th of April marked the beginning of a transformation - the trancension of fiction into reality. That Tuesday initiated the manifestation of Jay Gatsby within the broken man you see today. Just eight weeks later, he had engraved his name on his future coffin, he decided to pursue the impossible, a dream which was dead before it began, a dream of, for the first time in his life, not being maidenless. This dream was as the American Dream was to Gatsby - deceptive in nature, luring the determined in heart towards nothing short of tragedy. Still, he continued, with a naive sense of optimism, genuinely believing success was a reasonable possibility. Hours of time he invested in this endeavour, the mirage of attaining giga-chad status continually provided endless motivation from the day the seed was sown until that fateful hour. His confidence diminishing but his already heart too far gone. He realised his doom, but he had already reached the point of no return - fate surrounded him and the only way out was to finish the job. However, this journery came to an premature end. A mysterious man who bore classified information contacted him, revealing the truth that he would stay maidenless. Ignorance followed rejection and tragedy had struck. He followed a hopeless dream and faced an end far worse than he ever thought possible. And so, his Gatsby arc had been finally fulfilled, earning him the title 'Professional Gatsby'.</div>
